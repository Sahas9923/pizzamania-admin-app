## 🍕 PizzaMania – Admin Mobile Application

PizzaMania is a mobile-based food ordering platform developed as part of an academic Software Engineering coursework project.  
This repository contains the **admin-facing Android mobile application**, developed using **Android Studio and Java**, which enables restaurant administrators to manage orders, menus, and operational data efficiently.

The admin application is designed to work alongside the PizzaMania Customer Mobile Application, forming a complete role-based mobile ordering ecosystem.

## 📌 Project Overview

The PizzaMania Admin Mobile Application supports the **operational and administrative side** of the food ordering platform.  
It allows authorized users to manage incoming orders, update menu items, and monitor system activity in real time.

The overall PizzaMania platform consists of two separate Android mobile applications:

- 📱 **Customer Mobile Application** – for browsing menus and placing orders  
- 🛠️ **Admin Mobile Application** (this repository) – for system management and control  

This separation ensures **clear role-based access**, improved maintainability, and scalable application design.
